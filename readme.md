Miscellaneous Scripts
====================

This repository contains a bunch of small and unrelated scripts that don’t deserve their own repository. Everything here has been useful to me at least once, but it may not have any use for you. 

The scripts here have been tested with recent versions of either Windows 10 or Ubuntu, and many of them will work out-of-the-box. However, many of the scripts have (complex) dependencies which may cause strange errors if not installed.

**Note:** All of these scripts are functional (as in “it works on my computer”), but there are almost certainly bugs. Almost everything here would be unsafe to use with untrusted input, and many of the scripts will fail in very common edge cases. This is not to say that these scripts aren’t useful; they just have exactly enough functionality to serve my personal needs. If there is something that isn’t working as you expect, feel free to submit an issue or a PR.
